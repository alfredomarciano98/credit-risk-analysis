# credit-risk-analysis-using-logistic-regression


Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

In this repository I tried to do some analysis including EDA, feature engineering, etc to build predictive model using simple classification model such as Logistic Regression so I could find the stastical inference between properties and the target class. I am using data provided by Home Credit from https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/
